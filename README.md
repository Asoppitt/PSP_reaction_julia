# PSP_reaction_julia

Dependencies for the module and drivers are :Random, Distributions, StatsBase, LinearAlgebra, Statistics 
Additionally Plots is needed for the plotting code

for use, ensure  PSP_Particletracking_module.jl is in the same folder as the drivers

run any of the drivers in julia, it will save the data as a binary file
(PSP_Particletracking_reaction_driver.jl is currently the easiest to use, as is plug and play, the rest require path and file size specifications)

use Plotting_for_PSP.jl to produce the required plots
